EVs can be towed, just not with any tires on the ground.

The wheels are always connected to the motor, unlike in a gas car, where an engine can completely disconnect from the wheels. So when you try to move the EV, even if its in neutral, the motors will induce a current and that will damage the electronics and possibly fry the motor by getting extremely hot. This is why you always want a flat bed or something like this:

电动汽车可以牵引，只是地面上没有轮胎。
车轮总是与发动机相连，不像在汽油车中，发动机可以完全与车轮断开。因此，当您尝试移动电动汽车时，即使处于空档，电机也会感应电流，这会损坏电子设备，并可能因过热而烧坏电机。这就是为什么你总是想要一张平床或类似的东西：
